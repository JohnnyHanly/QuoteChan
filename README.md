# QuoteChan

QuoteChan is a quote rating website where users can submit quotes made others, or by themselves. Submitted quotes are displayed on the screen in real time, and are sorted based on the categories: Funny, Motivational, Thought-provoking, or Books/movies. The home page displays quotes from every category, and they can be upvoted and downvoted.
